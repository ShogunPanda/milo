# C++ API

The file `milo.h` defines several constants (`*` is used to denote a family prefix):

- `MILO_VERSION_MAJOR`: The current milo complete version as a string.
- `MILO_VERSION_MAJOR`: The current milo major version.
- `MILO_VERSION_MINOR`: The current milo minor version.
- `MILO_VERSION_PATCH` The current milo patch version.
- `AUTODETECT`: Set the parser to autodetect if the next message is a request or a response.
- `REQUEST`: Set the parser to only parse requests.
- `RESPONSE`: Set the parser to only parse response.
- `CONNECTION_*`: A `Connection` header value.
- `ERROR_*`: An error code.
- `METHOD_*`: An HTTP/RTSP request method.
- `STATE_*`: A parser state.

## `milo::Error`

A enum representing a possible error code.

## `milo::Method`

A enum representing a possible HTTP/RTSP method.

## `milo::State`

A enum representing a possible parser state.

## `milo::Callback`

All callback in milo have the following signature (`Callback`):

```cpp
intptr_t(*)(milo::Parser*, const unsigned char*, uintptr_t)
```

where the parameters have the following meaning:

1. The current parser.
2. A data slice. Can be `NULL` (and in that case the next parameter will be 0).
3. The data length. Can be `0` (and in that case the previous parameter will be `NULL`).

## `milo::Callbacks`

A struct representing the callbacks for a parser. Here's the list of supported callbacks:

- `before_state_change`: Invoked before the parser change its state. _Only available in debug mode_.
- `after_state_change`: Invoked after the parser change its state. _Only available in debug mode_.
- `on_error`: Invoked after the parsing fails.
- `on_finish`: Invoked after the parser is marked as finished.
- `on_message_start`: Invoked after a new message starts.
- `on_message_complete`: Invoked after a message finishes.
- `on_request`: Invoked after the message is identified as a request.
- `on_response`: Invoked after the message is identified as a response.
- `on_reset`: Invoked after the parser is reset (either manually or after parsing a new message except the first one).
- `on_method`: Invoked after the HTTP method has been parsed.
- `on_url`: Invoked after the request URL has been parsed.
- `on_protocol`: Invoked after the request or response protocol has been parsed.
- `on_version`: Invoked after the request or response version has been parsed.
- `on_status`: Invoked after the response status has been parsed.
- `on_reason`: Invoked after the response status reason has been parsed.
- `on_header_name`: Invoked after a new header name has been parsed.
- `on_header_value`: Invoked after a new header value has been parsed.
- `on_headers`: Invoked after headers are completed.
- `on_connect`: Invoked in `CONNECT` requests after headers have been completed.
- `on_upgrade`: Invoked after a connection is upgraded via a `Connection: upgrade` request header.
- `on_chunk_length`: Invoked after a new chunk length has been parsed.
- `on_chunk_extension_name`: Invoked after a new chunk extension name has been parsed.
- `on_chunk_extension_value`: Invoked after a new chunk extension value has been parsed.
- `on_data`: Invoked after new body data is received (either chunked or not).
- `on_body`: Invoked after the body has been parsed. Note that this has no data attached so `on_data` must be used to save the body.
- `on_trailer_name`: Invoked after a new trailer name has been parsed.
- `on_trailer_value`: Invoked after a new trailer value has been parsed.
- `on_trailers`: Invoked after trailers are completed.

If you want to remove a previously set callback, you can use `milo::milo_noop`.
