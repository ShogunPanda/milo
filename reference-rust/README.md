# Milo Rust Reference

This folder contains a simple reference Rust executable that uses milo.

In order to build it you need [make].

To build it simply execute:

```shell
$ make
```

This will generate two executables in the `dist` directory `reference-debug` and `reference-release`.

The debug version will also show the parser state changes.

[make]: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
